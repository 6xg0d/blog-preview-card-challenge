## My process
The HTML coding was pretty easy, but still i took my time to think about how it'd be better to structure the content and being as semantic as possible. This challenge gave a few problems, specially with the margins and spaces. And even when the space between the footer and the paragraph description isn't the same, i'm still happy with this result. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project i was able to practice a little bit more of flexbox, and explore a little bit more about Figma and how to use it.

### Continued development

I want to work more with Figma, improve my CSS skills and be able to positionate elements exactly where i want. Planning to add even more interactivity in the future to this card preview!
